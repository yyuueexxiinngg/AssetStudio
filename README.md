# AssetStudioMod

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/5qyai0hqs0ktyara/branch/AssetStudioMod?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/aelurum/assetstudiomod/branch/AssetStudioMod)

**AssetStudioMod** - modified version of Perfare's [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio), mainly focused on UI optimization and some functionality enhancements.

**Neither the repository, nor the tool, nor the author of the tool, nor the author of the modification is affiliated with, sponsored, or authorized by Unity Technologies or its affiliates.**

Since the original repo has been archived, it's worth saying that you shouldn't expect support for newer versions of Unity from this fork. 
Unfortunately, I can't continue Perfare's work and keep AssetStudio up to date.

- Command-line for Portable versions (.NET 6+): `dotnet AssetStudioModCLI.dll <asset folder path>`

### Basic Samples

- Show a list with a number of assets of each type available for export
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -m info
```
- Export assets of all supported types
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path>
```
- Export assets of specific types
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -t tex2d
```
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -t tex2d,sprite,audio
```
- Export assets grouped by type
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -g type
```
- Export assets to a specified output folder
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -o <output folder path>
```
- Export Live2D Cubism models
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -m live2d
```
> When running in live2d mode you can only specify `-o`, `--log-level`, `--log-output`, `--export-asset-list`, `--unity-version` and `--assembly-folder` options.
Any other options will be ignored.

### Advanced Samples
- Export image assets converted to webp format to a specified output folder
```

```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -t audio --filter-by-name voice
```
- Export audio assets that have "char" in their names **or** containers
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -t audio --filter-by-text char
```
- Export audio assets that have "voice" in their names **and** "char" in their containers
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -t audio --filter-by-name voice --filter-by-container char
```
- Export MonoBehaviour assets that require an assembly folder to read and create a log file
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -t monobehaviour --assembly-folder <assembly folder path> --log-output both
```

```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> --unity-version 2017.4.39f1
```

## GUI Usage

### Load Assets/AssetBundles

Use **File->Load file** or **File->Load folder**.

When AssetStudio loads AssetBundles, it decompresses and reads it directly in memory, which may cause a large amount of memory to be used. You can use **File->Extract file** or **File->Extract folder** to extract AssetBundles to another folder, and then read.

### Extract/Decompress AssetBundles

Use **File->Extract file** or **File->Extract folder**.

### Export Assets, Live2D models

use **Export** menu.

### Export Model

Export model from "Scene Hierarchy" using the **Model** menu.

Export Animator from "Asset List" using the **Export** menu.

#### With AnimationClip

Select model from "Scene Hierarchy" then select the AnimationClip from "Asset List", using **Model->Export selected objects with AnimationClip** to export.

Export Animator will export bound AnimationClip or use **Ctrl** to select Animator and AnimationClip from "Asset List", using **Export->Export Animator with selected AnimationClip** to export.

### Export MonoBehaviour

When you select an asset of the MonoBehaviour type for the first time, AssetStudio will ask you the directory where the assembly is located, please select the directory where the assembly is located, such as the `Managed` folder.

#### For Il2Cpp

First, use [Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper) to generate dummy dll, then when using AssetStudio to select the assembly directory, select the dummy dll folder.

## Build

* Visual Studio 2022 or newer
* **AssetStudioFBXNative** uses [FBX SDK 2020.2.1](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-2-1), before building, you need to install the FBX SDK and modify the project file, change include directory and library directory to point to the FBX SDK directory
